# APEX Sprint Progress

## Sprint 7 — Foundation (Q1 2026, week 1-2) — COMPLETE

8/8 tasks closed. 4 follow-up gaps opened for Sprint 8.

- [x] **G-A1**: Split `apex_finance/lib/main.dart` (2146 → 21 lines).
  - Branch: `sprint-7/g-a1-split-main-dart` (merged)
- [x] **G-S1**: bcrypt rounds → 12 explicit + opportunistic rehash.
  - Branch: `sprint-7/g-s1-bcrypt-12` (merged)
- [x] **G-Z1**: ZATCA encryption — closure + docs.
  - Branch: `sprint-7/g-z1-zatca-encryption` (merged)
- [x] **G-B1**: OAuth (Google + Apple) — closure + docs.
  - Branch: `sprint-7/g-b1-oauth-real` (merged)
  - Discovery: full verification in Wave 1 PR#2/PR#3 (26 tests passing).
  - Fixed `CLAUDE.md` line 74 — was misleading any reader to re-implement Wave 1.
- [x] **G-A2 (partial)**: Deprecate V4 router.
  - Branch: `sprint-7/g-a2-deprecate-v4-router` (merged)
  - Follow-up: **G-A2.1** opened to migrate 6 V4-only screens (Sprint 8).
- [x] **G-A3 (partial)**: Alembic baseline.
  - Branch: `sprint-7/g-a3-alembic-baseline` (merged)
  - Discovery: 7 migrations cover only 25/108 tables (drift = 2097 lines).
  - Decision: lifespan **NOT** modified. `create_all()` remains canonical.
  - Follow-up: **G-A3.1** opened (Sprint 8, DBA-reviewed).
- [x] **G-T1 (partial)**: Flutter widget test foundation.
  - Branch: `sprint-7/g-t1-flutter-tests` (merged)
  - Added `apex_finance/test/widget/apex_output_chips_test.dart` (5/5 passing).
  - Follow-up: **G-T1.1** opened (Sprint 8).
- [x] **G-B2**: SMS verification — closure + docs.
  - Branch: `sprint-7/g-b2-sms-docs`
  - Discovery: full Unifonic+Twilio+Console + OTP store implementation
    already shipped (10 tests passing).
  - **Restored corrupted `.env.example`** (PR #103/#104 merge accidentally
    overwrote env vars with PROGRESS.md content) — now contains canonical
    structure (Environment, Database, Auth, Admin, CORS, AI, Email, Payment,
    Storage, Observability, CSRF, Multi-tenancy, Audit log, Backups,
    Encryption keys, Social auth) **plus** the new SMS / OTP section.
  - Fixed `CLAUDE.md` line 75 — was misleading any reader to re-implement
    Wave SMS work.
